This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js where unhandled promise rejections can lead to server crashes. The `bug.js` file contains a server that performs an asynchronous operation. If the operation fails, the error is not properly handled, causing the server to crash. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by using a `process.on('unhandledRejection', ...)` to catch and gracefully handle the error.
